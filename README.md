# This project

In this project we create a simple website using html and bootstrap styles, this website contains
a job application form.
To create a backend for our app we use Flask framework, which is simpler Python framework for websites,
using Flask for our backend ensures our program processes the user's input on webpage correctly.
To use this app you want to replace "SENDER's EMAIL" on line 13 with your working email and line 14 "YOUR GMAIL APP PASSWORD"
with an actual app password you create with gmail.
